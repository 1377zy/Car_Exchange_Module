3. Start the application with `npm start` or `npm run start:prod`

**Features**:
- Uses a real MongoDB database
- Requires MongoDB to be installed or accessible

### 3. Cloud Deployment (Render.com)

**Best for**: Production deployment with minimal infrastructure management.

**Steps**:
1. Run `node deploy-to-render.js` to prepare the application
2. Push code to GitHub
3. Create a new Web Service on Render.com
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure build and start commands
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy

**Features**:
- Automatic CI/CD from GitHub
- Managed database options
- SSL/TLS certificates included

### 4. Docker Deployment

**Best for**: Containerized deployment in various environments.

**Steps**:
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`

**Features**:
