## Deployment Scripts

The following npm scripts have been added to `package.json` for easy deployment:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "node deploy.js",
    "deploy:render": "node deploy-to-render.js",
    "deploy:railway": "node deploy-to-railway.js",
    "deploy:heroku": "node deploy-to-heroku.js",
    "deploy:local": "node deploy-local-dev.js",
    "github:setup": "node setup-github-repo.js",
    "verify": "node verify-deployment.js",
    "check": "node check-environment.js"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Workflow

The recommended deployment workflow is as follows:

1. Check the environment for required dependencies:
   ```
   npm run check
   ```

2. Set up a GitHub repository:
   ```
   npm run github:setup
   ```

3. Develop locally:
   ```
   npm run deploy:local
   ```

4. Deploy to a cloud service:
   ```
   npm run deploy:render
   # or
   npm run deploy:railway
   # or
   npm run deploy:heroku
   ```

5. Verify the deployment:
   ```
   npm run verify
   ```
