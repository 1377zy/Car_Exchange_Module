- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Use the render.yaml configuration for automatic setup
- [ ] Create a new Static Site on Render.com for the frontend
- [ ] Connect the same GitHub repository
- [ ] Set the build command to `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- [ ] Set the publish directory to `client/build`
- [ ] Verify deployment was successful
- [ ] Test API endpoints and frontend functionality

### Cloud Deployment - Railway.app

- [ ] Run `node deploy-to-railway.js` to prepare for deployment
- [ ] Install Railway CLI (if using CLI deployment)
- [ ] Login to Railway and link project
- [ ] Deploy application with Railway CLI or dashboard
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Verify deployment was successful

### Cloud Deployment - Heroku

- [ ] Run `node deploy-to-heroku.js` to prepare for deployment
- [ ] Install Heroku CLI (if using CLI deployment)
- [ ] Login to Heroku and create a new app
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Add MongoDB addon
- [ ] Deploy application with Heroku CLI or dashboard
- [ ] Verify deployment was successful

### Docker Deployment

- [ ] Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
