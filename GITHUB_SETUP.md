# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new GitHub repository and pushing your Car Exchange Module code to it.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Car Exchange Module code on your local machine

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "car-exchange-module")
4. Add a description (optional): "Business Development Center (BDC) application for auto dealerships"
5. Choose the repository visibility (Public or Private)
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your Car Exchange Module directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/Car_Exchange_Module
   ```

3. If you haven't already initialized Git, do so:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/car-exchange-module.git
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `car-exchange-module` with your repository name.

5. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   You may need to authenticate with your GitHub credentials.

## Step 3: Verify the Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and commit history

## Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

The Car Exchange Module includes a GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. This workflow will automatically run tests and build the application when you push changes.

To enable GitHub Actions:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

## Step 5: Configure Branch Protection (Optional)

For better code quality, you can set up branch protection rules:

1. Go to "Settings" > "Branches"
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Enter "master" as the branch name pattern
4. Check "Require pull request reviews before merging"
5. Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
6. Check "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
7. Click "Create"

## Next Steps

Now that your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. Deploy the application to a cloud service (see DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md)
2. Set up continuous integration and deployment
3. Invite collaborators to your repository
4. Create issues for new features or bugs

For more information on deploying the application, see the README.md and DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md files.
