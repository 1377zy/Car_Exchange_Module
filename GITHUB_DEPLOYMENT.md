# GitHub Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the Car Exchange Module to GitHub and then to a cloud hosting service:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., "car-exchange-module")
4. Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private
5. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/car-exchange-module.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `car-exchange-module` with the name of your repository.
